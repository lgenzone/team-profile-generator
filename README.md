# Meet the Team!

 ## Description
Meet the Team! was created to help a software engineering team by generating an HTML website with information about the team members. This Node.js command-line application prompts the user with questions about the employee based on their role. This app displays all of the information from the user on one page so that the employees of the software engineering company can easily view some basic information relating to their team members. <br/>
 I was given the opportunity to improve my coding skills and knowledge by creating this object-oriented programming (OOP) project.

 ## Installation 
 Visual Studio Code, Node.js

 ## Usage 
 Use the following command line to lauch the application: node.js <br/>
 After initiating the app, respond to each question. When finished, your HTML page will be created with all of the employee information that was provided. <br/>
